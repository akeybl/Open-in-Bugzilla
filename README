About ===
Copy/paste appears to be the method of choice for viewing specific bug numbers in bugzilla, so I've thrown together a small OS X service that allows you to select bug #s in text and use a keyboard shortcut to open (1 bug) or list them (n bugs) on bugzilla.mozilla.org. Note that bug #s <100, 1990-2020, and >100000000 are not considered bugs.

Compatibility ===
Mac OS X 10.5 or later (only 10.7 tested)

History ===
v0.1 - Initial commit

How to Install ===
1) Open Finder
2) Shift+cmd+g to ~/Library/
3) Go to Services (create the folder if necessary)
4) Unzip "BugParser.zip" into that folder (you should now see BugParser.service in that directory)
5) Log-out and back in or run the following at the commandline:
    /System/Library/CoreServices/pbs

6) Go to System Preferences, the Keyboard Pane, Services and find "Open in Bugzilla"
7) Click the checkbox to enable the service, and double-click to the right of the label to set a keyboard shortcut
8) Now select some text and hit your keyboard shortcut to launch Bugzilla in the default web browser.
